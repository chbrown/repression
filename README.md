## Facebook CSS

Facebook obfuscates their CSS, but they don't try too hard, and it's not impossible to figure out.
The notation below uses CSS selector syntax.

* `.mbm` is the going rate for the highest ancestor that contains exactly one individual feed post.
* There can be multiple `._5pcb` divs, which contain multiple `.mbm` divs
* `#substream_0` is the container of `.mbm`'s at page-load, but new feed posts are not added inside it.
* We watch for changes to `#contentArea`, which contains a lot of the page, but all we want with that watcher is a single common ancestor of all potential `._5pcb`'s.
* `.userContent` is the container of original text within a feed post. It may not exist, or it may be totally empty; e.g., for photos.
* `.navLink[title=Timeline]` will get the link to the user's personal profile page, which is how we capture their username.
* `.fwb` contains the feed post's author's name. In some cases it contains the target, too, but it's hard to pull them apart further than this.
